# Websource

Thank you for checking out my first React-based app, websource!

Websource is an open-source app made to share resources that we come across when searching the web.

## If you would like to add your own resource, here's all you have to do:

1. Fork this repository to your own computer.
2. Open the resources.js file.
3. You will see a list of objects that looks like this:
   `{ "id": 1, "name": "HTML5", "image": "./img/html5.png", "desc": "HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web." }`
   This is what you will update with your own resource that you find.
4. When you are done, push it to the main branch. If the post is accepted, it will show up on the app for all to see!

## More to come:

1. First and foremost, getting those "Docs" and "Downloads" buttons working. Should be done in the next update.
2. Getting the thumbnails to show up properly on the cards. If anyone wants to help figure this out, please, be my guest!
3. The app is a little bland, so styling will be a must.
4. Organizing folders.
5. If you have any other suggestions, please let me know!
